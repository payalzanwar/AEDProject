# Head-On With Medicine Non-Compliance

Pharmaceutical companies are the backbone of the healthcare industry and the most booming sector across the globe. Today, due to the improved healthcare facilities and extensive research, a much larger pool of people can access medications for a variety of acute and chronic diseases.

Accessibility being taken care of, affordability is still a challenge for many. Skyrocketing prices make the drugs difficult to attain and thus leading to a phase of medicine-noncompliance by the patients putting them and the society at risk.There are certain companies that try to reach out to accommodate the needs of those who cannot afford to buy expensive medicines by providing them with a cheaper alternative, but the reach is limited.
  
Our aim is to enable consumers to pick from expert-approved alternatives for costly medicine that can be accessed by all categories of patients.

# Features
1. This application not only provides a platform for patients to communicate directly with their preferred hospitals, doctors, and pharmaceutical companies, but also accommodates the emerging medicine manufacturing companies to place their medicines with the same salt compositions as the existing giant brands for cheaper cost in the market efficiently. 
2. This application also demonstrates the way to adhere to supply chain ethics, ensuring the track of medicine supply right from the manufacturer to consumer.
3. Patient can search for cheaper alternatives in generic medicines for a prescribed medicine and place the order upon approval from a doctor.
4. For placing the request for approval, the patient can have their preferred hospital and doctor. The preferred hospitals and doctors are given priority during request assignment.
5. Patient can email special medical conditions or special request while consulting a doctor.
6. Facility for patients to order “over the counter” medicines directly.
7. Track of medicine supply to adhere to supply chain ethics, avoiding loop holes in the medicine supply.
8. Demonstration of Push Request Model for Hospital-Doctor communication as well as Pull Request Model for Pharmacy-Supplier-Manufacturer and Pharmacy-Shipping Manager-Delivery Manager communication.
